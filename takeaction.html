                <h3>THE 5 MOST IMPACTFUL CHANGES</h3>
                <p>
                <b>1. Start composting</b><br>
                    This is by far the fastest way to reduce what you send to landfill.
                    As soon as we started composting, we reduced the need the need to put out the trash from once a week to once every few months
                    (if that) turns out a lot of our trash was organic matter that is so valuable for enriching soil win!
                     <br> <br>
                <b>2. Collect hard to recycle (but still recyclable) things</b> <br>
                    Recycling is a last resort, but alas sometimes we do find ourselves there.
                    Before throwing anything out of the ordinary in the trash, do a little research (like understanding the different types
                    of plastic we typically find in our consumer goods) first to see what can / can't be recycled, if there are any designated
                    drop-offs (like municipal recycling facilities) or dispose of them through Terracycle who recycles all sorts of things.
                    Examples of these hard to recycle (but still recyclable) items include e-waste, batteries, polystyrene, toothpaste tubes,
                    electric toothbrush heads, etc.
                    <br><br>
                <b> 3.Always carry a reusable water bottle and coffee cup </b><br>
                    Sounds simple?
                    That’s because it is, but it's so impactful. You can save on average of 156 bottles annually by just using an eco friendly bottle or plastic free water bottle.
                    <br><br>
                <b>4.Carry re-usable shopping bags and just don't use produce bags </b><br>
                    Again, since doing this, we have completely eliminated plastic shopping bags, which was a huge source of waste for us going back 5+ years (ridiculous to think of it now).
                    We also just don't use produce bags and instead wash our fresh food really well when we do buy from a store
                    <br><br>
                <b>5.Aim for zero waste personal care and beauty items </b><br>
                    Again a simple change but aside from food and drink, these are the products we buy most often so finding zero waste alternatives makes a big difference.
                    <br> <br> </p>
                <h3>WHEN OUT AND ABOUT</h3>
                <p>
                 <b>1.Plastic water bottles and takeaway coffee cups: </b>
                    Two words: reusable and insulated.  Not only can you reduce all that single-use waste, but you can keep your water colder and your coffee hotter for way longer
                    than in plastic or paper.
                    If you're having coffee in the cafe, be sure to request it "for here"; many coffee shops now use ceramic mugs for that!
                    We've actually found it's sometimes important to even say "for here in a glass cup, not disposable please" – nothing more crazy than folks
                    sitting down for coffee with takeaway disposable coffee cups!
                    <br><br>

                 <b>2.Plastic cutlery and straws: </b>
                    There are loads of stainless steel or bamboo alternatives and most eco friendly cutlery sets even come in cute, handy little to-go storage bags.
                    <br><br>

                 <b>3.Plastic grocery bags: </b>
                    Do all your shopping (grocery or otherwise) with reusable totes and cotton or mesh net produce bags.
                    You've probably already got something that will work lying around the house!
                    If you happen to forget your tote (no biggie, we've all done it), request paper instead, which is at least compostable.. or just carry it if you can!
                    <br><br>

                </p>

                                <h3>KITCHEN WASTE</h3>
                <p>
                 <b>1.Coffee and tea: </b>
                    Aside from getting your caffeine fix in a reusable mug, buy coffee and tea to make at home. And if you swap to a french press or stovetop
                    espresso maker, you can also refuse disposable coffee filters (which are compostable but tend to be wrapped in plastic) or coffee pods.
                    <br><br>

                 <b>2.Disposable cookware and pan liners:  </b>
                    Here we mean things like paper plates, styrofoam cups, wax paper, and aluminum foil.  These all come from society's preference for
                    the quick-and-easy and essentially just reduce the amount of cleanup you have.  Easier to take out the trash than wash all those backyard BBQ dishes.
                    Take the small hit and save the environment a big one by just avoiding these and investing in eco friendly cookware.
                    <br><br>

                 <b>3.Plastic food containers:  </b>
                    If you already have Tupperware and other plastic food containers, that's fine; keep using them. Don't buy more.
                    Instead if you do actually need more, opt for plastic free food storage containers in the form of glass or metal.
                    <br><br>

                </p>

                                                <h3>BATHROOM WASTE</h3>
                <p>
                 <b>1.Plastic razors:</b>
                  Save tons of money (not to mention billions of disposable razors hitting the landfill each year) by shaving with a straight razor or safety razor and shaving soap bars.
                    <br><br>

                 <b>2.Tampons and period pads:  </b>
                    See what women everywhere are calling "life changing" by swapping to a menstrual cup (like the Saalt and Diva Cups), reusable liner pads,
                    and absorbent period panties like those by Modibodi.
                    <br><br>

                 <b>3.Plastic toothbrushes, toothpaste paste tubes, and floss:  </b>
                    Plastic isn't good for the planet or for us, so let's stop putting it on our mouths. Instead,
                    use zero waste toothpaste, compostable floss, and a plastic free toothbrush. And if you can't do without the buzz, opt for a sustainable electric toothbrush.
                    <br><br>
