                        <p>Everyone wants to live and visit places that are clean, fresh and healthy. A city with poor
                            sanitation, smelly and with waste matter all over the place do not attract good people,
                            investors and tourists. Such cities tend to have poor living standards.

                        <h3>Soil contamination</h3>
                        <p>Hazardous chemicals that get into the soil (contaminants) can harm plants when they take up
                            the contamination through their roots. If humans eat plants and animals that have been in
                            contact with such polluted soils, there can be negative impact on their health.</p>

                        <p>All glass products like broken bottles, beer and wine bottles can be recycled.Bad waste
                            management practices can result in land and air pollution and can cause respiratory problems
                            and other adverse health effects as contaminants are absorbed from the lungs into other
                            parts of the body.</p>

                        <h3>Leachate</h3>
                        <p>Liquid that forms as water trickles through contaminated areas is called Leachate. It forms
                            very harmful mixture of chemicals that may result in hazardous substances entering surface
                            water, groundwater or soil.</p>

                            Technically, this is called water pollution. This will affect all ecosystems existing in the
                            water. It can also cause harm to animals that drink from such polluted water.

                        <p>Cities that do not invest in recycling and proper waste control miss out on revenue from
                            recycling. They also miss out on job opportunities that come from recycling, composting and
                            businesses that work with them.</p>
